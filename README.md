Instructions

Using the random module and the range method, generate a list of 20 random numbers between 0 and 49.
import random

random_numbers = [...insert awesome code here...]
print(random_numbers)
With the resulting list, use a list comprehension to build a new list that contains each number squared. For example, if the original list is [2, 5], the final list will be [4, 25].
